We interviewed 5 users who love active recreation, have dogs or kids, and enjoy spending time outside; we also created a survey about parks and recreation use, which received 96 responses. 

                <br><br>The research uncovered many common themes: who users visit parks with; parks & recreation features they seek; travel distances & methods; and, how they search for parks and recreation areas. We used these themes to create our final User Persona, who visits parks with her family and dog, likes exercising, and wants to find ways to accommodate all of her family members at the park.
